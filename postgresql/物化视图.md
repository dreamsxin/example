If you want the old behavior in later versions of TimescaleDB, set the `timescaledb.finalized` parameter to false when you create your continuous aggregate.

## IoT dataset

This continuous aggregate resulted in 1,760,000 rows of aggregated data spanning seven years of data.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW hourly_trip_stats
WITH (timescaledb.continuous, timescaledb.finalized=false) 
AS
SELECT 
	time_bucket('1 hour',pickup_datetime) bucket,
	avg(fare_amount) avg_fare,
	min(fare_amount) min_fare,
	max(fare_amount) max_fare,
	avg(trip_distance) avg_distance,
	min(trip_distance) min_distance,
	max(trip_distance) max_distance,
	avg(congestion_surcharge) avg_surcharge,
	min(congestion_surcharge) min_surcharge,
	max(congestion_surcharge) max_surcharge,
	cab_type_id,
	passenger_count
FROM 
	trips
GROUP BY 
	bucket, cab_type_id, passenger_count
```
## Stock transactions dataset

This continuous aggregate resulted in 950,000 rows of data at the time of testing, although these are updated as new data comes in.
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW five_minute_candle_delta
WITH (timescaledb.continuous) AS
    SELECT
        time_bucket('5 minute', time) AS bucket,
        symbol,
        FIRST(price, time) AS "open",
        MAX(price) AS high,
        MIN(price) AS low,
        LAST(price, time) AS "close",
        MAX(day_volume) AS day_volume,
        (LAST(price, time)-FIRST(price, time))/FIRST(price, time) AS change_pct
    FROM stocks_real_time srt
    GROUP BY bucket, symbol;
```
## Query #1: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM…`
Doing a COUNT(*) from PostgreSQL is a known performance bottleneck. It's one of the reasons we created the approximate_row_count() function in TimescaleDB which uses table statistics to provide a close approximation of the overall row count. However, it's instinctual for most users (and ourselves, if we're honest) to try and get a quick row count by doing a COUNT(*) query:
```sql
-- IoT dataset
SELECT count(*) FROM hourly_trip_stats;

-- Stock transactions dataset
SELECT count(*) FROM five_min_candle_delta;
```

## Query #2: SELECT COUNT(*) Based on The Value of a Column
Another common query that many analytic applications perform is to count the number of records where the aggregate value is within a certain range:
```sql
-- IoT  dataset
SELECT count(*) FROM hourly_trip_stats
WHERE avg_fare > 13.1
AND bucket > '2018-01-01' AND bucket < '2019-01-01';

-- Stock transactions dataset
SELECT count(*) FROM five_min_candle_delta
WHERE change_pct > 0.02;
```

## Query #3: Select Top 10 Rows by Value
Taking the first example a step further, it's very common to query data within a range of time and get the top rows:
```sql
-- IoT dataset
SELECT * FROM hourly_trip_stats
ORDER BY avg_fare desc
LIMIT 10;

-- Stock transactions dataset
SELECT * FROM five_min_candle_delta
ORDER BY change_pct DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED view 物化视图名称 as 查询语句 with DATA

## WITH NO DATA
-- Continuous aggregates
-- Define view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW weather_metrics_daily WITH ( timescaledb.continuous ) AS SELECT
time_bucket ( '1 day', TIME ) AS bucket,
city_name,
AVG ( temp_c ) AS avg_temp,
AVG ( feels_like_c ) AS feels_like_temp,
MAX ( temp_c ) AS max_temp,
MIN ( temp_c ) AS min_temp,
AVG ( pressure_hpa ) AS pressure,
AVG ( humidity_percent ) AS humidity_percent,
AVG ( rain_3h_mm ) AS rain_3h,
AVG ( snow_3h_mm ) AS snow_3h,
AVG ( wind_speed_ms ) AS wind_speed,
AVG ( clouds_percent ) AS clouds 
FROM
	weather_metrics 
GROUP BY
	bucket,
	city_name
WITH NO DATA;
### 手动刷新
refresh_continuous_aggregate(物化视图名称, 'sdate', 'edate')
### 自动刷新
-- create policy-- refresh the last 6 months of data every 2 weeks
SELECT add_continuous_aggregate_policy ( 'weather_metrics_daily', start_offset => INTERVAL '6 months', end_offset => INTERVAL '1 hour',   schedule_interval  =>  INTERVAL  '14 days' )
```


## 从聚合查询变为连续聚合

可以通过CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW命令触发数据库创建具有给定名称的物化视图，（相当于里面是有数据存储的）WITH (timescaledb.continuous)指示 TimescaleDB 创建一个连续的聚合，而不仅仅是一个通用的物化视图。最后，在AS关键字之后添加之前的查询。
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW stock_candlestick_daily
WITH (timescaledb.continuous) AS
SELECT
  time_bucket('1 day', "time") AS day,
  symbol,
  max(price) AS high,
  first(price, time) AS open,
  last(price, time) AS close,
  min(price) AS low
FROM stocks_real_time srt
GROUP BY day, symbol;
```
查询数据的话只需要查询当前视图数据即可
```sql
SELECT * FROM stock_candlestick_daily ORDER BY day DESC, symbol;
```
### 实时连续聚合

默认情况下，所有连续聚合都创建为实时聚合。这意味着 TimescaleDB 会将UNION尚未通过刷新策略具体化的最新数据附加（或）到连续聚合的输出中

使用和设置连续聚合策略：

1、自动连续聚合刷新策略
```sql
--此策略每天运行一次，由 设置schedule_interval。当它运行时，
--它会具体化 3 天前到 1 小时前的数据，由 start_offset和设置end_offset。
--偏移时间是相对于查询执行时间计算的。
--执行的查询是在连续聚合中定义的查询stock_candlestick_daily。
SELECT add_continuous_aggregate_policy('stock_candlestick_daily',
  start_offset => INTERVAL '3 days',
  end_offset => INTERVAL '1 hour',
  schedule_interval => INTERVAL '1 days');
```
2、手动刷新

这在插入或修改超出刷新策略start_offset和end_offset间隔的数据时最有用。这在边缘物联网系统中很常见，其中设备长时间失去互联网连接，并在重新连接后最终发送历史读数。
```sql
--此手动刷新仅更新您的连续聚合一次。它不会自动使聚合保持最新。
--要设置自动刷新策略，请参阅前面关于连续聚合刷新策略的部分。
--当前语句是刷新1周前到当前的数据到连续聚合中
CALL refresh_continuous_aggregate(
  'stock_candlestick_daily',
  now() - INTERVAL '1 week',
  now()
);
```
