	pushl $8 		# the number you want to square, x=?, push second argument

#PURPOSE: 		This function is used to compute
# 			the value of a square, that is x^

#INPUT: 		First argument - the base number
# 			Second argument - the power to raise it to
# 				
#
#OUTPUT: 		Will give the result as a return value
#
#NOTES: 		The power must be 1 or greater
#
#VARIABLES:
# 				%ebx - holds the base number
# 				%ecx - holds the power
#
# 				-4(%ebp) - holds the current result
#
# 				%eax is used for temporary storage
#
